# 🤖 Generative AI Applications with RAG and LangChain

This project is an **end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application** built as part of the *Generative AI Applications with RAG and LangChain* course.  
It combines **six core concepts** across **eight hands-on labs** to create a fully functional AI application using LangChain.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the complete RAG workflow, integrating document processing, embeddings, vector databases, and a user-friendly interface.

### **Core Concepts Implemented**
1. **Document Loader** – Load and parse documents from various formats for processing.  
2. **Text Splitter** – Break large documents into manageable text chunks for better retrieval.  
3. **Embedding Creation** – Convert text into numerical vectors using embedding models.  
4. **Vector Database** – Store embeddings in a searchable vector store for efficient retrieval.  
5. **Retriever** – Fetch the most relevant document chunks for a given query.  
6. **Streamlit Interface** – Build an interactive web application for querying the RAG system in real time.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **LangChain**
- **Streamlit**
- **Vector Databases** (Chroma)
- **Embedding Models** (e.g., OpenAI, HuggingFace)
- **Document Parsers** (e.g., PyPDF2, Unstructured)
